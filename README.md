xgp is a machine learning tool for classification and regression based on [genetic programming](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Genetic_programming).

If you want to use xgp in a data science pipeline then you probably want to use it in one of the following ways:

- [Command-line interface (CLI)](cmd/README.md)
- [Python package](python-package/README.md)

You can also simply install the `xgp` Go package and use it from within your Go code.

```sh
go get -u github.com/MaxHalford/xgp
```
